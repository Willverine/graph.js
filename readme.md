# Graph.js Lib


# Aims:
This project is designed to make the drawing of mathematical functions easier.

# How: 
Through creating a simple module the drawing of functions and data should be easier. There are
many libraries for drawing graphs and charts but so far there are few that can draw basic mathematical
functions with the ease that we were looking for. 

This is designed to be simple to use and light-weight with as much functionality we can provide
yet without it becoming too heavy.

# Uses:
Drawing simple functions, showing mathematical transformtions on functions, demonstrating convolutions, 
in a easy to use and easily modifiable package. 

# Examples:
Create Object; feed in a data array; draw(); modify values in the data array.
